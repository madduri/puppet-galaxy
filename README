galaxy

This is the galaxy module for a basic Galaxy installation, not for production. Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for accessible, reproducible, and transparent computational biomedical research.

Important note
--------------

During its first run, galaxy installs some python eggs, it takes times, so be patient, if your web page does not come up (http://127.0.0.1:8080), wait 5 to 10 minutes depending of your hardware.

Using it :
----------

* To stop it :

sudo /etc/init.d/galaxy stop

* To run it again :

sudo /etc/init.d/galaxy restart
